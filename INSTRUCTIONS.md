**My Notes**
When we're building an application, we're getting data from the client side. The only way to get data from client side is request.body object.

### Database (MySQL)

1. We need to create a database. Since we're working with sample database called sakila. We are fine.
2. Create the appropriate tables in database. We have already tables created for us.
